# Backorder Tracking System

## Overview and Purpose

DFCI pharmacy places orders weekly for drugs through RxScan from three different sources, ABC (the primary wholesale source), Drop Ship, and Buy Direct (for more expensive drugs). DFCI relies on suppliers of these medications for patient care. However there are situations occur in the industry that disrupt the supply chain and these produce drug shortages. ABC has a report of the status of supplies for each drug that it supplies that we can download as needed. This has been used as a reference for Pharmacy to evaluate any anticipated shortages/interruptions and to help understand the impact of these shortages/interruptions.

Hilary then uses this information to manually create a spreadsheet that reports on just the medications that DFCI uses from the ABC report. The effect of a shortage is measured by taking the current inventory at DFCI and dividing by the weekly rate of use over the previous 3-4 month period of time (using the RxScan Transaction Log as a data source) to establish how many days' supply is available on hand. This is then color-coded based on the number of days' supply with 0-30 Red, 31-60 Yellow and <60 Green. This report is used in meetings with leadership regarding current status of supply chain issues and their resolution.
